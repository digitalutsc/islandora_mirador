## Introduction
A Drupal 9 field formatter and block that can display an image or paged content using an IIIF image server and the Mirador viewer.

More information on the Mirador viewer can be found on the [Project Mirador](https://projectmirador.org/) page.

## Requirements
- Drupal Token
- Islandora IIIF (use the drupal_view branch from [this repository](https://github.com/digitalutsc/iiif_view_manifest/tree/drupal_view). The drupal_view branch does not require islandora or islandora_core_feature)
- A IIIF image server (such as Cantaloupe)

## Installation
As a Drupal module, this module can be installed using Composer, Drush, or file upload. More in depth instructions can be found on [Drupal's docs](https://www.drupal.org/docs/extending-drupal/installing-modules).

## Configuration
Remember to first set up the configuration for the Islandora IIIF module and the IIIF image server.

This module's configuration can be found under Configuration > Media > Mirador Settings (`admin/config/media/mirador`). This is where the IIIF Manifest URL for single media should be configured, and this should link to the path of the Media IIIF Manifest view. Configuration of the IIIF Manifest URL for content with multiple pages is done separately when placing a block.

## Usage
### Field Formatter (single images)
The field formatter can be used to display content with a single image. This works on content that contains a field with an entity reference to a media item of the image type.

To use the field formatter, change the display format to Mirador under Structure > Media types > Image > Edit > Manage display (`admin/structure/media/manage/image/display`).

### Block (paged content)
The block can be used to display paged content. This can work with a couple different node structures, but all require the manual set-up of a IIIF Manifest view.

#### Setting up a IIIF Manifest view
To create a new IIIF Manifest view go to Structure > Views > Add view (`admin/structure/views/add`), check "Provide a REST export", and provide a path (such as `node/%node/book-manifest`).

1. Under Advanced > Relationships, add a relationship to the field used for images.
2. Under Format, change the Show from "Entity" to "Fields".
3. Add a field "Image" from category "Media", and ensure that the relationship is the one set up in the earlier step.
4. Under Format, change the Format from "Serializer" to "IIIF Manifest", and make sure the Media is selected under Tile source field(s).
5. Under Advanced > Contextual Filters, add a contextual filter based on the structure of your content.

Below are some examples of content structures and ways to set up the contextual filter for the manifest view:

- Recommended: For a content type where each node only has 1 image and each node has a field that specifies if the node is a "part of" another node, the contextual filter can be set as the name of that field "part of".
- For a content type where each node can have more than 1 image, the filter can be set as the content ID.

The filter and sorting criteria in the view can be modified as wanted.

#### Placing the block
Once the manifest is set up, the block can be placed by going to Structure > Block layout (`admin/structure/block`) and placing the Mirador block under Content. When prompted for a IIIF Manifest URL, enter the URL to the manifest created earlier. The block's visibility can be set, just like any other Drupal block.
